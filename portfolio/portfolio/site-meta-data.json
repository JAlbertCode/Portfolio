    "description": "Futurist reverse engineering the products and services of tomorrow, today. Turning visions into projects, projects into milestones, and milestones into tasks providing software development teams with roadmaps to the future. Seven years of experience gathering requirements, rapid prototyping, managing and coordinating cross-functional teams in both start-up and global operations. Boundless curiosity has lead to work with organizations focused on language learning, politics, finance and augmented reality and real estate. </br></br>I created this website because my <a href='/assets/Jonathan_Albert_Resume.pdf' target='_blank'>Resume</a> and my <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-albert-profile/' target='_blank'> LinkedIn </a> do not effectively convey my interests and capabilities. The website was built using Gatsby.js and is hosted by Netlify. The design seeks to reflect my experiences working with sophisticated stakeholders, my holistic perspective, my capacity to remain calm under pressure, and my ability to adapt to change. Below are projects I have contributed to and subjects I am interested in. Click on each of the images to learn more about the projects."
